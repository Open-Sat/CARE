This file defines the cFE environment used by CARE.

The cfe-dir defines the base directory of where the CFS has been 'deployed' on the user's desktop. The CFS mission
directory structure is assumed by CARE. The CFS mission directory could be from the CM system used manage the code
being downloaded to a target machine.

Notes:
1. ip-Address must have 3 digits per field. Some common VMware IP settings for a VM on a Windows machine:
   Host-only (vmnet1): 192.168.211.001 (Windows), 192.168.211.128 (VM)
   NAT (vmnet8):       192.168.146.001 (Windows), 192.168.146.128 (VM)
   Bridge: 10.0.0.19 (VM)

2. Default Apps (def-apps) is a comma separated list of XML files names without file extensions
3. Tool commands are commands that will appear on the toolbar when the app starts. 
   PREFIX:FC where PREFIX = the app prefix exactly as defined in app's XML and FC = command function code defined in app's header file
4. Tick Duration (specified in milliseconds) must less than or equal to 1000ms and must go into 1000 evenly.
5. Apache's log4j utility is used for logging messages to a file and/or to the console. log4j.properties is used to configure the logging behavior
   and is loacted in the top-level src directory.

Todo:
1. Add support for different directory path formats
